# Catan Time

A simple timer for Real-Time Settlers of Catan.

In Real-Time Settlers of Catan, players take their turns simultaneously.
This timer helps keep the game moving by automatically
rolling the dice at regular intervals.

Choose your turn interval (recommended: 30 seconds)
and the timer will automatically roll the dice.

Fair dice are also the default, meaning those pips actually matter!

This can be turned off if you prefer, but I will judge you.

Apparently Catan is now creating [their own version](https://www.catan.com/connect) of this.
It'll probably be another $60 game to buy.
This works with any version of Catan. Just use this!

This was inspired by [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40633671);
I wanted to create my own version with better sound and visual effects.
Fun story: I met the [colonist.io](https://colonist.io) dev—Demi—that commented an intention to try it out!
They had forgotten and never actually tried it, so we played some games together!

## Developing

Once you've created the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

I'll consider pull requests to this project, though I encourage you to create your own version instead.
