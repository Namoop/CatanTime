# Catan Time

A simple timer for Real-Time Settlers of Catan.

In Real-Time Settlers of Catan, players take their turns simultaneously.
This timer helps keep the game moving by automatically rolling the dice at regular intervals.

Choose your turn interval (recommended: 30 seconds)
and the timer will automatically roll the dice.

Fair dice are also the default, meaning those pips actually matter!

This can be turned off if you prefer, but I will judge you.

## Features

- Set turn interval
- Automatically roll dice
- Fair dice
- Pause and resume timer
- Reset timer
- Sound effects on roll
- Visual effects on roll
- Doesn't explode (most devices)


## Developing

Once you've created the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
